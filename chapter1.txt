Chapter One: The Map in the Ivy
Liora Vale didn’t believe in ghosts. Not the kind that rattled chains or whispered from shadows. But she did believe in traces—scents in soil, pressure in the air, plants that grew differently where something once happened.

That’s why she was crouched behind the ruined chapel at dusk, her fingers brushing through ivy like she might find a secret curled beneath it. The wind had a sour taste, like metal and burnt paper. A storm was thinking about coming.

She found the stone half-buried under roots. It had markings—faint lines that looped and crossed. A map? Or vandalism? Liora tilted her head and traced the shape. It pulsed warm under her fingertips. She pulled out her field journal and sketched it quickly.

“You’re standing on someone’s grave.”

The voice made her jerk back. A man stood ten feet away, coat open, boots caked in red mud. His face was sharp, angular—like something drawn in charcoal and smudged at the edges.

“And you are?” she asked, brushing dirt off her knees.

“Cass Rowe. Used to make maps. Now I mostly get lost.”

He smiled like it was a private joke. Liora didn’t return it.

“You know what this is?” She held up her sketch.

Cass stepped closer, glanced at the markings. “Old border symbols. Not used since the Western Collapse. You’re a little off the grid, botanist.”

“How do you know I’m a botanist?”

“Your boots are covered in thistle seeds. And your bag smells like mold and lavender.” He shrugged. “I pay attention.”

Before she could decide whether to be impressed or unsettled, a new sound cracked through the trees—heels on stone. Deliberate. Impossibly clean.

Mireya Thorn emerged like a wound in the landscape. Blood-red gloves, hair pinned into a flawless knot, not a leaf on her.

“I see the weeds have gathered,” she said coolly, eyes flicking from Liora to Cass. “How quaint.”

Liora stiffened. “You’re trespassing.”

Mireya laughed. “So are you. But I suppose grief makes everyone territorial.”

That stung more than it should have. Mireya always knew where to cut.

“I’m not here for sentiment,” Liora said. “I found a marking.”

“Yes,” Mireya replied, circling the grave like a panther. “And you should leave it alone. That stone’s part of something much older than your little notebooks.”

Cass stepped slightly in front of Liora. “If it’s so dangerous, why are you here?”

Mireya didn’t answer. She smiled instead, the kind that belonged in stained-glass windows—beautiful,
